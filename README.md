# AWQ Quantization (Activation-aware Weight Quantization)

AWQ Quantization, also known as Activation-aware Weight Quantization, is a technique specifically designed to compress large language models (LLMs) for efficient deployment on various hardware, particularly resource-constrained devices.

## Overview

AWQ recognizes that some weights in an LLM are more critical for maintaining accuracy than others. It leverages techniques to identify these important weights and ensures they are preserved with higher precision during quantization. Less important weights can be quantized more aggressively, leading to significant size reduction without sacrificing performance.

## Key Features

- **Selective Quantization**: AWQ selectively quantizes weights based on their significance to model accuracy, allowing for adaptive precision allocation.
- **Size Reduction**: By quantizing less important weights more aggressively, AWQ achieves significant reduction in model size, facilitating deployment on resource-constrained devices.
- **Performance Preservation**: Despite compression, AWQ endeavors to maintain model performance by prioritizing precision for critical weights.
